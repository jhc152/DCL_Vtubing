# SimpleJSON
A C# json reader/writer which is Unity3D compatible based on http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SimpleJSON

The official Github repo for this script can be found at https://github.com/Bunny83/SimpleJSON/blob/master/SimpleJSON.cs

This repository includes improvements that are mostly a bunch of unit tests (compatible with Unity test runner) which verify that things work like it should, and some performance improvements. The unit tests helped discover some stuff where this implemention did not follow the json standard and they were fixed.
